# Golf-Score-Sheet
A very simple golf score card using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This was just a fun project for me as I was watching the Ryder Cup.  It is very basic, but gave me some practice using JavaScript.

You can enter the name of a Golf Course, plus two Players
The Sheet will automatically add up your total score and show your score (after Par).
